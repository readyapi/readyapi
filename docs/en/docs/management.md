# Repository Management

Here's a short description of how the ReadyAPI repository is managed and maintained.

## Owner

I, <a href="https://github.com/khulnasoft" target="_blank">@khulnasoft</a>, am the creator and owner of the ReadyAPI repository. 🤓

I normally give the final review to each PR before merging them. I make the final decisions on the project, I'm the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" class="external-link" target="_blank"><abbr title="Benevolent Dictator For Life">BDFL</abbr></a>. 😅

## Team

There's a team of people that help manage and maintain the project. 😎

They have different levels of permissions and [specific instructions](./management-tasks.md){.internal-link target=\_blank}.

Some of the tasks they can perform include:

- Adding labels to PRs.
- Editing PR titles.
- Adding commits on top of PRs to tweak them.
- Mark answers in GitHub Discussions questions, etc.
- Merge some specific types of PRs.

You can see the current team members in [ReadyAPI People - Team](./readyapi-people.md#team){.internal-link target=\_blank}.

Joining the team is by invitation only, and I could update or remove permissions, instructions, or membership.

## ReadyAPI Experts

The people that help others the most in GitHub Discussions can become [**ReadyAPI Experts**](./readyapi-people.md#readyapi-experts){.internal-link target=\_blank}.

This is normally the best way to contribute to the project.

## External Contributions

External contributions are very welcome and appreciated, including answering questions, submitting PRs, etc. 🙇‍♂️
