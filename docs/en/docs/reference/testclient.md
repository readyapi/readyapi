# Test Client - `TestClient`

You can use the `TestClient` class to test readyapi applications without creating an actual HTTP and socket connection, just communicating directly with the readyapi code.

Read more about it in the [readyapi docs for Testing](https://readyapi.khulnasoft.com/tutorial/testing/).

You can import it directly from `readyapi.testclient`:

```python
from readyapi.testclient import TestClient
```

::: readyapi.testclient.TestClient
