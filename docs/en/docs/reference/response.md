# `Response` class

You can declare a parameter in a _path operation function_ or dependency to be of type `Response` and then you can set data for the response like headers or cookies.

You can also use it directly to create an instance of it and return it from your _path operations_.

You can import it directly from `readyapi`:

```python
from readyapi import Response
```

::: readyapi.Response
